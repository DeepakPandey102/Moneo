## Duplicate receipts + Market page (October 2026)

**Duplicate receipt popup** (`src/utils/duplicates.js`, `src/pages/Transactions.jsx`)
- Scanning a photo that was already saved shows a popup *before* the AI is called (no quota wasted): "Cancel" or "Scan anyway".
- A different photo of an already-saved receipt is detected by card approval number (승인번호), or by store + date + amount (+ purchase time). A popup shows the saved one next to the new scan: "Don't save" or "Save anyway".
- Manual entries with the same store, date and amount get the same popup.
- The AI now also reads `receipt_time` and `approval_number` from receipts (`backend/src/services/receiptService.js`).
- Only fingerprints are stored (SHA-256 of the photo, time, approval number), never the image.

**Market page** (`src/pages/Market.jsx`, `backend/src/routes/market.js`)
- Watchlist: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Gold, Litecoin, XRP, Solana, BNB, Dogecoin in USD with 24h/7d change and 7-day sparklines; filter and sort.
- Market indicators: total crypto market cap, 24h volume, Bitcoin dominance, Fear & Greed index (gauge + history).
- Price chart with 24H/7D/1M/3M/1Y, MA 20 / MA 50 overlays and RSI 14, plus trend, change, high/low, swing.
- Asset details (market cap, supply, all-time high; gold per gram and per 돈) and a compare chart against any other asset.
- Data: CoinGecko + alternative.me, cached on the backend. Optional `COINGECKO_API_KEY` in `backend/.env`.

# Moneo — bug-fix pass (Sept 2026)

## Setup step you must do once
Run `backend/supabase_migration_001.sql` in Supabase → SQL Editor. The app
still works without it, but Ask Anything memory is less efficient.
If you deploy the frontend (e.g. Vercel), add its URL to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
in `backend/.env` (see `backend/.env.example`).

## Critical — data loss
- **First transaction / first budget / first goal / funds added disappeared.**
  Pages called two context functions in one click (e.g. `addTransaction` +
  `unlockAchievement`). Both started from the same old `data`, so the second
  save overwrote the first. Context now applies every change to the latest
  state (`mutate`) and saves through a queue so an older save can never land
  after a newer one. (`src/context/AppContext.jsx`)
- **A network error while loading could wipe the account.** `getUserData`
  returned empty data on *any* error; the next save wrote that empty object
  over the real data. It now throws, and the app shows a Retry screen.
  (`src/utils/storage.js`, `src/App.jsx`)
- **Saves silently did nothing if the user's row was missing** (`update` on 0
  rows "succeeds"). Now uses `upsert`, and a missing row is created on load.
- **Settings: confirming "Log out" in one card showed a "Clear all data"
  confirmation in the Demo Tools card** — clicking Confirm there wiped data.
- Data no longer reloads on every hourly token refresh (could overwrite
  in-progress edits).

## Wrong numbers / dates
- Dates used UTC (`toISOString`) — in Korea anything entered before 9am got
  yesterday's date; the add-transaction default date was also frozen at page
  load. New `src/utils/dates.js` uses local time everywhere.
- Saving streak showed up to 60 days for brand-new users (counted empty days
  before the first transaction).
- Division by zero for goals/budgets with a 0 target → `NaN%` / `Infinity%`.
- Negative or zero amounts could be saved.
- Budgets form defaulted to "food" even when food already had a budget →
  duplicate budgets.
- Receipt amounts like `"17,450.00"` parsed as 1,745,000; receipt payment
  methods like "신용카드" are now mapped to Card/Cash/Transfer/Other.

## Assistant / Ask Anything
- Korean IME: pressing Enter sent the message twice (second time with the
  leftover last syllable).
- Demo mode read "50만원" as ₩50; now understands 만/천/억. Afford questions
  are matched before category/"this month" keywords.
- Regenerate sent the question to Gemini twice (in history and as message).
- Memory summarization re-summarized the whole old history on every reply
  once a thread passed 16 messages (slower + costlier each time). Now only
  new messages are folded in.
- New chat: the user's first message vanished from screen while waiting.
- Failed send + Retry saved the user's message twice.
- Switching chats while a reply was loading painted it into the wrong chat.

## Mobile
- Analytics, Budgets, Goals, Notes were unreachable on phones (sidebar is
  hidden, bottom nav didn't include them). Added a "More" sheet.

## Backend
- CORS was open to every website → any site you visited could use your
  Gemini key through your running backend. Now an allowlist
  (`ALLOWED_ORIGINS`).
- Simple rate limit (30 AI requests/min per IP).
- Receipt scanning asks Gemini for strict JSON, and "today" uses
  `APP_TIMEZONE` (default Asia/Seoul) instead of UTC.

## Smaller
- Toast could disappear early when a new toast replaced an old one.
- IDs could collide within the same millisecond.
- Delete confirmations for transactions, budgets, goals.
- Login/registration errors no longer say "wrong password" / "fill in all
  fields" for network problems.
- About text said the app uses localStorage (outdated).

# Redesign + Google login (Sept 28)
- New landing + login page from the team mockup: Seoul night hero, "made in Korea" headline,
  animated floating cards, feature sections below the fold, EN/한국어 switch before login.
- Continue with Google (redirect) and Google One Tap (automatic "Continue as …" popup).
- Working Forgot password → email link → "Set a new password" screen.
- Supabase switched to PKCE so Google/reset links work with the HashRouter.
- New app shell: sidebar + top bar with smart search (questions go to the AI assistant,
  everything else searches transactions), budget-alert notifications, profile menu with
  Google photo, Receipts shortcut.
- New dashboard: month picker, Total balance / Spent / Remaining budget vs last month,
  animated spending chart (this month or 6 months), category donut, scan-receipt card,
  recent transactions, and an inline Moneo AI chat. All numbers come from real data.
- Blue→purple theme applied to every page; Plus Jakarta Sans font; new logo and favicon.

# Landing sections, dashboard v2, deploy-ready (Sept 28)
- Real Seoul night photo as the landing hero and About us background.
- New landing sections: How it works (4 steps), Our goal (why use Moneo), About us (team),
  FAQ (9 questions), Contact us (GitHub / phone / email / Instagram), full footer.
- Team and contact details live in `src/data/team.js`.
- Dashboard v2 from the team mockup: Goals card, This Month's Summary, AI assistant in the
  right rail, AI banner, "Small steps" card, sidebar Moneo AI card with robot.
- Backend: `trust proxy` so the rate limit is per visitor when hosted behind a proxy.
- Deploy files: `render.yaml`, `vercel.json` caching, GitHub Actions CI, `.nvmrc`,
  stricter `.gitignore`, `DEPLOY.md`.

# Speed, mobile, language & polish (Sept 28)
- Receipt scanning is much faster: photos are shrunk in the browser (≈1600px, ~300 KB)
  before upload, and the AI server is woken up as soon as the app opens.
- Korean receipts are translated into the app language; the original text is shown
  small underneath (review screen, transaction list, dashboard).
- Landing page: sections open by clicking (Home, Features, How it works, Goals,
  About us, FAQ, Contact) instead of one long scroll; mobile menu added.
- Streak now counts only days you actually logged something (being away no longer
  inflates it).
- Settings: Demo mode and sample-data tools removed; AI service status shown instead.
- Sidebar: "Powered by Supabase" removed.
- Dropdown lists (e.g. Budgets category) are now dark and readable.
- Error messages always follow the app language (browser validation popups, which
  used the computer's language, are replaced by Moneo's own messages).
- Friendlier AI error messages; long names no longer overlap amounts; charts use ₩K/₩M labels.
- Landing: removed the "Explore" chips under the hero (the top menu covers it).
- App: removed the top search bar (it mixed searching with asking the AI).
  Transactions keeps its own search box; the AI has its own pages.
- Removed all sample-data code (Generate Sample Month and demoData.js), so an
  account only ever contains what its user entered.
